# Build-a-simple-client-side-MVC-app-with-RequireJS
As a web developer, you certainly often started coding your JavaScript in a single file, and, 
as the code base gets bigger, it became really difficult to maintain. To solve this problem you 
can split your code in several files, add more script tags and use global variables to reach functions 
declared in other files. But this pollutes the global namespace and for each file an additional HTTP request consumes 
bandwidth, which slows down the loading time of the page.  If this happened to you, you certainly understand that there 
is a strong need to organize our front-end code differently, particularly if we have to build large-scale web apps with
thousands of lines of JavaScript. We need a new way to organize all this mess to make it easier to maintain. So by using 
Require.Js you can make life easy for yourself and team and make your script load faster
